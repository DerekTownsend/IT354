        <h2>Responsive Design Video</h2>
        <p>I never used "flex: 1" before, and it is nice to know that it exists. I learned a bit more about webkits because originally I just thought that they were used to make your designs compatiable in different browsers(namely safari). They have more layers than I originally thought. The tip about using filter drop shadow on pngs I never knew existed and can be fairly useful later on. When he is dealing with height, width and position he is using percentages which I appreciate a great deal because they are crucial to responsive design. The transform: translate feature he used to move the laptop select could have saved me a lot of time in the past if I am understanding it correctly. </p>
        <p>The part I had the biggest problem with was the liberal use of display flex on main content. Display flex is very intensive if it used to control and change large parts of the websites, and can get very laggy. I use display grid once I start messing with that much of the content. I was taught that pixels are taboo for responsive design  unless you are doing small tweaks or are feeling lazy. I have had a lot of issue with animations in the past and just don't like them anymore, not a insult to him I just don't like them. I'm pretty sure he uses vh without really explaining it, but I may have just missed it. But overall he explains himself very well and wrote clean and concise code.</p>
