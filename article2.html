    <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
    <section>
      <div class="article">
        <h2>Responsive Design Video</h2>
        <p>I never used "flex: 1" before, and it is nice to know that it exists. I learned a bit more about webkits because originally I just thought that they were used to make your designs compatiable in different browsers(namely safari). They have more layers than I originally thought. The tip about using filter drop shadow on pngs I never knew existed and can be fairly useful later on. When he is dealing with height, width and position he is using percentages which I appreciate a great deal because they are crucial to responsive design. The transform: translate feature he used to move the laptop select could have saved me a lot of time in the past if I am understanding it correctly. </p>
        <p>The part I had the biggest problem with was the liberal use of display flex on main content. Display flex is very intensive if it used to control and change large parts of the websites, and can get very laggy. I use display grid once I start messing with that much of the content. I was taught that pixels are taboo for responsive design  unless you are doing small tweaks or are feeling lazy. I have had a lot of issue with animations in the past and just don't like them anymore, not a insult to him I just don't like them. I'm pretty sure he uses vh without really explaining it, but I may have just missed it. But overall he explains himself very well and wrote clean and concise code.</p>
        <h2>Common Usability Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Tiny clickable links is now something that I overcompensate for by making all my links very large fonts with a generous but logical padding. I've seen the issues on sites and it makes it annoying to browse on mobile.</p>
        <p>No way to search isn't relaevant for all websites. Some sites are fairly straight forward and have little content (which the article does bring up but I still feel the need to say it). Most websites I use for shopping do have a search at this point.</p>
        <p>Registration Requirements I feel is more acceptable for phone applications because most applications now do require them upon installation, but for websites if you lock you content behind registration or a paywall I will just find a different source.</p>
        <h2>5 Key Principles Of Good Website Usability</h2>
          <p>Availablity & Accessibility are crucial especially if you are running a business. Any downtime can cost you a great deal of money and poor mobile accessibility can lead to users becoming frustrated and leaving your site. Accessibility for people with disablities is a great addition once you get your core functionality working.</p>
          <p>Clarity is always important because users don't want to spend a lifetime on your site trying to decipher the paragraphs you've written. Deliver your most important information first and then direct them to a more dedicated page if you want to go into more detail. </p>
          <p>Learnability I interpreted as being consistent with web standards and not doing anything too out of the ordinary on the webpage. I agree these standards became standards for a good reason. </p>
          <p>Credibility is somethingthat is a bit more difficult to maintain if you are a smaller team because small mistakes can easily slip through if it isn't throughly vetted or are to eager to stand out and go with bizzare design patterns.</p>
          <p>Relevancy tells me that you shouldn't show content that isn't important to what you are selling are buying. I shouldn't see picture of top selling shoes in the US if I'm on website that sells cars. </p>
